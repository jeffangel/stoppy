# Installing Stoopy

To install the stoppy package, a virtual Python environment is recommended; There are different alternatives for Python 3, I recommend pipenv.

To install pipenv, you can run "pip install pipenv"

After cloning this repository, place it in the main folder and run "pipenv shell". This will create the virtual environment.


Then you will need to run "pipenv install" to install all the necessary packages.

Finally, run "pip install --upgrade".

To start the program, simply run "stoopy" from the terminal (within the virtual environment).
